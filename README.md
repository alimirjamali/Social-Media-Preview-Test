# Background
Github generates social media preview for repositories. This is useful when you post the link to a repository on Twitter or other social media platforms.
Username, repository name and description will be included in this preview. 

## Current Issue
Unfortunately the font used to generate this preview does not support some languages. I have tested Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Chinese, Korean and Japanese here:

![Preview Fail](/preview-fail.png)

You could see that this font does not support Arabic/Hebrew/Persian characters.

## Solution
It would be possible to solve this issue by switching to a font which supports more languages. This font ideally should:

1. Support all major common languages.
2. Have a Free Font license (at no cost to Github).
3. Excellent Legibility.

Selecting a proper font with the above requirements is beyond my personal knowledge. 
I could consult with some of my friends who are active in Fontography community and ask them if they could provide recommendations.
